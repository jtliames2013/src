793. Preimage Size of Factorial Zeroes Function
DescriptionHintsSubmissionsDiscussSolution
Let f(x) be the number of zeroes at the end of x!. (Recall that x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * x, and by convention, 0! = 1.)

For example, f(3) = 0 because 3! = 6 has no zeroes at the end, while f(11) = 2 because 11! = 39916800 has 2 zeroes at the end. Given K, find how many non-negative integers x have the property that f(x) = K.

Example 1:
Input: K = 0
Output: 5
Explanation: 0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! end with K = 0 zeroes.

Example 2:
Input: K = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no x such that x! ends in K = 5 zeroes.
Note:

K will be an integer in the range [0, 10^9].

Some basic observations:

The number of trailing zeros of the factorial x! is given by the minimum of num_2 and num_5, where the former is the total number of factor 2 of integers in the range [1, x], while the latter is the total number of factor 5 of these integers. Since we always have more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros of x! will always be num_5.

num_5 of x! can be computed by summing up the count of integers in the range [1, x] that are integer multiples of 5, 25, 125, …, 5^k, …, etc. A simple implementation is as follows:

private long numOfTrailingZeros(long x) {
    long res = 0;
		
    for (; x > 0; x /= 5) {
        res += x/5;
    }
		
    return res;
}
Given two non-negative integers x and y, if x <= y, then numOfTrailingZeros(x) <= numOfTrailingZeros(y), which implies numOfTrailingZeros is a non-decreasing function of x.

The first binary solution is based on the third observation where we search the range of integers such that the numOfTrailingZeros function is evaluated to K, as shown below.

Binary search solution ONE -- search for x range:

This solution takes advantage of the last observation mentioned above, where we use binary search to find the largest integers x and y such that numOfTrailingZeros(x) <= K and numOfTrailingZeros(y) <= K-1, respectively. Then the factorial of all integers in the range (y, x] (left exclusive, right inclusive) will have K trailing zeros. Therefore the total number of non-negative integers whose factorials have K trailing zeros will be given by x - y.

The following is the Java code for this solution, where the time complexity is O((logK)^2) and space complexity is O(1). Note that x! will always have at least x/5 trailing zeros, therefore, if y is the largest integer such that y! has no more than K trailing zeros, then we have y <= 5 * (K + 1), which can serve as the upper bound of our binary search.

public int preimageSizeFZF(int K) {
    return (int)(binarySearch(K) - binarySearch(K - 1));
}
    
private long binarySearch(int K) {
    long l = 0, r =  5L * (K + 1);
    
    while (l <= r) {
        long m = l + (r - l) / 2;
        long k = numOfTrailingZeros(m);
        
        if (k <= K) {
            l = m + 1;
        } else {
            r = m - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return r;
}

More advanced observations:

Let K = numOfTrailingZeros(x), then K will jump whenever x is an integer multiple of 5 (this is a direct result of the fact that the number of factor 5 in x! will change whenever x is an integer multiple of 5). The step of the jump will be given by the number of factor 5 in x (no factorial). For example, K will jump by 1 step at x = 5, 10, 15, 20, but by 2 steps at 25, as demonstrated in the following plot:

image

Since the steps of the jump may be greater than 1, not all integer values can be taken by K. For example, K cannot be 5 as the step at x = 25 is two so K will jump from 4 directly to 6, thus skip the middle value of 5 (see the red dashed line between two brown lines in the above plot). We shall call these skipped integers as invalid values for K and conclude there are NO integers x such that x! has K trailing zeros at these K values. Furthermore, for each valid K value, there will be exactly FIVE integers x such that x! has K trailing zeros (this is because if x is an integer multiple of 5, then x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4 will have no factor of 5, thus the jump step at each of these points will be 0, which implies K will remain the same in the range [x, x+4]). In summary, we conclude the number of integers x such that x! has K trailing zeros will be either 0 or 5, where the former corresponds to invalid K values while the latter corresponds to valid K values.

As a direct result of the above observation, all the valid K values will form an ordered list of ranges where each range consists of 5 continuous integers, i.e., the valid K values are: [0, 5), [6, 11), [12, 17), …, etc. The K values will break up whenever x is an integer multiple of 25 and the size (i.e., number of elements) of the gap between the two separated ranges will be given by the number of factor 5 in x minus 1 (note it’s the number of factor minus 1, not x, and is equivalent to the number of factor 5 in x/5).

The following three solutions are all based on the fact that the number of integers x such that x! has K trailing zeros will be 0 when the given K value is invalid, and wil be 1 if the given K value is valid. So all we need to do is to determine whether the given K value is valid or not.

Solution TWO takes advantage of the fact that if the given K value is valid, then there must exist at least one integer x such that x! has K trailing zeros.

Solution THREE takes advantage of the third observation above and tries to find the largest valid range with a start point no more than the given K.

Solution FOUR takes advantage of the recursive structure of the invalid K values and tries to verify directly if the given K value falls into this structure.

Binary search solution TWO -- search for x value:

This solution makes use of the aforementioned observation that the total number of non-negative integers x such that x! has K trailing zeros will be either 0 or 5. So we can directly try binary search to find one such integer. If it exists, the K value is valid so we return 5; otherwise we return 0. The time and space complexities are the same as the first solution above, except now we only need to do the binary search once instead of twice.

public int preimageSizeFZF(int K) {
    for (long l = 0, r =  5L * (K + 1); l <= r;) {
        long m = l + (r - l) / 2;
        long k = numOfTrailingZeros(m);
        
        if (k < K) {
            l = m + 1;
        } else if (k > K) {
            r = m - 1;
        } else {
            return 5;
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}

Binary search solution THREE -- search for valid K values:

As mentioned above, the valid K values will form an ordered list of ranges separated by gaps. We can order them as follows:

index:      0        1           2      ...       m
range:    [0, 5)   [6, 11)    [12, 17)  ...  [T_m, T_m + 5)
gaps:  {}       {5}       {11}          ... 
If we take all valid ranges and gaps before index m, we know those values will fill up the range [0, T_m), in which there are m * 5 valid values (we have m valid ranges and each range contains 5 elements), and sum(gap_i) invalid values (where gap_i is the number of elements in the i-th gap with 0 <= i <= m, and we define that the i-th gap is immediately preceding the i-th range). So we obtain:

T_m = m * 5 + sum(gap_i)

Now to compute T_m, we need to evalutae sum(gap_i). To evalutae sum(gap_i), we need to refer to its definition: the number of elements in the i-th gap. We know that a gap is generated whenever x is an integer multiple of 25 and the number of elements in the gap is given by the number of factor 5 in x/5. Therefore the i-th gap corresponds to x_i = i * 25, and sum(gap_i) is equivalent to the total sum of factor 5 of integers in the range [1, 5*m], which by definition is given by numOfTrailingZeros(m * 5). So we arrive at:

T_m = m * 5 + numOfTrailingZeros(m * 5)

For the given K, we can do a binary search to find the largest index m such that T_m <= K, then K will be valid if and only if it falls within the m-th range. The following is the code for this solution, with time and space complexities the same as the first solution.


public int preimageSizeFZF(int K) {
    long l = 0, r = K/5;
        
    while (l <= r) {
        long m = l + (r - l) / 2;
        long k = m * 5 + numOfTrailingZeros(m * 5);
            
        if (k <= K) {
            l = m + 1;
        } else {
            r = m - 1;
        }
    }
		
    return (K < r * 5 + numOfTrailingZeros(r * 5) + 5 ? 5 : 0);
}
Binary search solution FOUR -- search for invalid K values:

In constrast to the previous solution, this solution tries to directly identify the set containing all the invalid K values and check if the given K value falls into this invalid set. To build the invalid set, we will divide the x values into ranges of the form (0, 5^m] and find the skipped values in the corresponding K ranges (recall that the skipping will happen whenever x is an integer multiple of 25), for example,

m = 1: the corresponding K range is [0, 1] and no values in this range are skipped, so the invalid set is empty. We will denote it as S1 = {} with length f1 = 0.

m = 2: the corresponding K range is [0, 6] and we do have one value that is skipped, which is 5. So the invalid set will be S2 = {5} with length f2 = 1.

m = 3: the corresponding K range is [0, 31] and we have multiple values that are skipped. In this case, the invalid set will be S3 = {5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 30} with length f3 = 6.

… and so on

Note that the invalid set for the x range (0, 5^m] can be constructed from that of (0, 5^(m-1)]. This is because (0, 5^m] can be subdivided into five smaller ranges:

(0, 5^(m-1)]
(5^(m-1), 2 * 5^(m-1)]
(2 * 5^(m-1), 3 * 5^(m-1)]
(3 * 5^(m-1), 4 * 5^(m-1)]
(4 * 5^(m-1), 5 * 5^(m-1)]

All these subranges will contain the same number skipped K values except for the last one, which produces one additional invalid K value due to an extra factor of 5 at x = 5^m. Let’s take m = 3 as an example, where the x range is (0, 125]. The five subranges are (0, 25], (25, 50], (50, 75], (75, 100], (100, 125]. There will be one K value skipped for each of the first four ranges: (0, 25], (25, 50], (50, 75], (75, 100], and two K values skipped for the last range (100, 125] due to the extra factor of 5 at x = 125 (compared to x = 25).

So in general we have f_m = 5 * f_(m-1) + 1. Now to construct S_m from S_(m-1), we have to find the values skipped in each of the last four subranges. Note that they are not just copies of S_(m-1), but instead, will be S_(m-1) shifted by some value (that is, a new set obtained by shifting the elements in S_(m-1)). The shifting value will be an integer multiple of f_m, so that we have:

Subranges:                          Skipped values
(0, 5^(m-1)]                        S_(m-1)
(5^(m-1), 2 * 5^(m-1)]              S_(m-1) + f_m
(2 * 5^(m-1), 3 * 5^(m-1)]          S_(m-1) + 2 * f_m
(3 * 5^(m-1), 4 * 5^(m-1)]          S_(m-1) + 3 * f_m
(4 * 5^(m-1), 5 * 5^(m-1)]          S_(m-1) + 4 * f_m
Therefore, S_m can be written in terms of S_(m-1) as:

S_m = {S_(m-1)} U {S_(m-1) + f_m} U {S_(m-1) + 2 * f_m} U {S_(m-1) + 3 * f_m} U {S_(m-1) + 4 * f_m} U {5*f_m}.

where U means union operation and the last single element 5 * f_m is due to the extra factor of 5 at x = 5^m.

Okay, we have obtained the recurrence relations for S_m, but apparently we cannot afford to compute its elements explicitly (which requires exponential space and time). So how do we check if the given K value is in S_m or not?

Our strategy is simple: first check if K is the single element 5 * f_m. If not, we will take the modulo with respect to f_m and recursively check to see if the remainder is in S_(m-1). We can do this because if an element is in the set S_(m-1) + k * f_m, then the remainder of the element with respect to f_m will be in the set S_(m-1).

So finally, here is the code for this solution. Note that the given K value does not exceed 10^9 so it makes no sense to test S_m with size greater than that, hence we start with the one with size right below 10^9, which happens to be 305175781. The time complexity is then given by O(logK) and space complexity O(1).


public int preimageSizeFZF(int K) {
    for (int f = 305175781; f >= 1; f = (f - 1) / 5) {
        if (K == 5 * f) return 0;
        K %= f;
    }
    
    return 5;
}

Lastly I should point out that johnsontau shared a post here with similar ideas. Go take a look if you like.
