Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum sum of a falling path through A.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row.  The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The possible falling paths are:
[1,4,7], [1,4,8], [1,5,7], [1,5,8], [1,5,9]
[2,4,7], [2,4,8], [2,5,7], [2,5,8], [2,5,9], [2,6,8], [2,6,9]
[3,5,7], [3,5,8], [3,5,9], [3,6,8], [3,6,9]
The falling path with the smallest sum is [1,4,7], so the answer is 12.

 

Note:

1 <= A.length == A[0].length <= 100
-100 <= A[i][j] <= 100

class Solution {
public:
    int minFallingPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        int n=A.size();
        for (int i=n-2; i>=0; --i) {
            for (int j=0; j<n; ++j) {
                A[i][j]+=min(min(A[i+1][j], j==0?INT_MAX:A[i+1][j-1]), j==n-1?INT_MAX:A[i+1][j+1]);
            }
        }
        return *min_element(A[0].begin(), A[0].end());
    }
};
